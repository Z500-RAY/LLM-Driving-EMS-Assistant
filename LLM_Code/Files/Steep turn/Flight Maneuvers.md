# Flight Maneuvers

##  Introduction

Airplanes operate in an environment that is unlike an automobile. Drivers tend to drive with a fairly narrow field of view and focus primarily on forward motion. Beginning pilots tend to practice the same. Flight instructors face the challenge of teaching beginning pilots about attitude awareness; which requires understanding the motions of flight. An airplane rotates in bank, pitch, and yaw while also moving horizontally, vertically, and laterally. The four fundamentals (straight-and-level flight, turns, climbs, and descents) are the principal maneuvers that control the airplane through the six motions of flight.
## The Four Fundamentals
The Four Fundamentals To master any subject, one should first master the fundamentals. For flying, this includes straight-and-level flight, turns, climbs, and descents. All flying tasks are based on these maneuvers, and an attempt to move on to advanced maneuvers prior to mastering the four fundamentals hinders the learning process. 

### Straight-and-level flight
The text explains the fundamentals of straight-and-level flight, emphasizing the importance of maintaining heading and altitude while forming effective flying skills. The key to mastering straight-and-level flight lies in the pilot's ability to use outside visual references and make timely and proportional control inputs to correct any deviations.

**Straight Flight:** 
Maintaining a constant direction or heading involves visually checking the airplane's wingtips relative to the horizon. Both wingtips should be level and equally above or below the horizon, with corrections made using coordinated ailerons and rudder. The bank attitude information can also be obtained from a quick scan of the attitude indicator (which shows the position of the airplane’s wings relative to the horizon) and the heading indicator (which indicates if the airplane is off the desired heading). The correct bank flight control movement requires the coordinated use of ailerons and rudder. Properly trimmed, an airplane in smooth air requires minimal control inputs.

Pilots may unconsciously focus on one side, often the left, due to seating position, causing unintended control pressures. A continuous, broad scan is essential for maintaining the correct attitude, avoiding fixation, and enhancing situational awareness. Observing both wingtips helps maintain level flight, monitor for traffic, and adjust for terrain or weather influences. To maintain a straight path, the pilot aligns two points on the horizon, using occasional instrument checks to stay on course. Over featureless areas like water or snow, the pilot should rely on magnetic heading indicators instead of surface references.

**Level Flight:**
To master level flight control, a pilot should maintain a light touch on the flight controls, using fingers rather than a tight grip. Minimal pressure should be applied to achieve the desired aircraft attitude, allowing the pilot to adjust the airplane's pitch without excessive reliance on instruments or outside references.

The correct pitch attitude is achieved by selecting a reference point near the airplane's nose and aligning it with the horizon. The principles of attitude flying require that the reference point to the natural horizon position should be cross-checked against the flight instruments to determine if the pitch attitude is correct. This alignment should be cross-checked with flight instruments to ensure altitude maintenance. In level flight maneuvers, the terms “increase the back pressure” or “increase pitch attitude” implies raising the airplane’s nose in relation to the natural horizon and the terms “decreasing the pitch attitude” or “decrease pitch attitude” means lowering the nose in relation to the natural horizon. The pilot’s primary reference is the natural horizon.

In straight-and-level flight, airspeed remains constant if power settings are unchanged. Changes in airspeed, induced by adjusting engine power, help the pilot maintain level flight. Additionally, changes in pitch may result from extending or retracting flaps, landing gear, or other drag devices, which should be practiced during airplane checkout.

**Common Errors:**
Beginners may improperly rely on the airplane’s nose rather than wingtips for maintaining level flight, leading to unnoticed deviations. Errors also include relying on instruments rather than the horizon, overcontrolling the airplane, not scanning outside for traffic, and flying with one wing low.

### Turns
#### Level Turns
A turn is initiated by banking the wings in the desired direction of the turn through the pilot’s use of the aileron flight controls. Left aileron flight control pressure causes the left wing to lower in relation to the pilot. Right aileron flight control pressure causes the right wing to lower in relation to the pilot. In other words, to turn left, the pilot lowers the left wing with aileron by left stick. To turn right, the pilot lowers the right wing with right stick. Depending on bank angle and airplane engineering, at many bank angles, the airplane will continue to turn with ailerons neutralized. The sequence could be as follows:
1. Bank the airplane, adding either enough power or pitching up to compensate for the loss of vertical lift.
2. Neutralize controls as necessary to stop bank from increasing and hold desired bank angle.
3. Use the opposite stick (aileron) to return airplane to level.
4. Neutralize the ailerons (along with either power or pitch reduction) for level flight.

A turn is the result of the following:
The ailerons bank the wings and determine the rate of turn for a given airspeed. Lift is divided into both vertical and horizontal lift components as a result of the bank. The horizontal component of lift moves the airplane toward the banked direction.
The elevator pitches the nose of the airplane up or down in relation to the pilot and perpendicular to the wings. If the pilot does not add power, and there is sufficient airspeed margin, the pilot needs to slightly increase the pitch to increase wing lift enough to replace the wing lift being diverted into turning force so as to maintain the current altitude.
The vertical fin on an airplane does not produce lift. Rather the vertical fin on an airplane is a stabilizing surface and produces no lift if the airplane is flying straight ahead. The vertical fin’s purpose is to keep the aft end of the airplane behind the front end.
The throttle provides thrust, which may be used for airspeed control and to vary the radius of the turn
The pilot uses the rudder to offset any adverse yaw developed by wing’s differential lift and the engine/propeller. The rudder does not turn the airplane. The rudder is used to maintain coordinated flight.

When an airplane is flying straight and level, lift acts perpendicular to the wings and the Earth. During a turn, lift is divided into two components: vertical, opposing gravity, and horizontal, opposing centrifugal force. The horizontal component turns the airplane, not the rudder. To maintain altitude during a turn, the angle of attack (AOA) and power must be increased to compensate for the divided lift. In constant altitude, constant airspeed turns, it is necessary to increase the angle of attack (AOA) of the wing when rolling into the turn by increasing
back pressure on the elevator, as well to add power countering the loss of speed due to increased drag. When the pilot deflects the ailerons to
bank the airplane, both lift and drag are increased on the rising wing and, simultaneously, lift and drag are decreased on the lowering
wing. This increased drag on the rising wing and decreased drag on the lowering wing results in the airplane yawing
opposite to the direction of turn. To counteract this adverse yaw, rudder pressure is applied simultaneously with the aileron deflection
in the desired direction of turn. Coordinated flight is crucial to avoid unintentional spins, particularly at low altitudes.

#### Establishing a Turn in Flight
##### 1. **Initial Setup and Bank Angle Determination**
- **Visual Reference**: In light single-engine airplanes, the flat surface of the engine cowling aligned with the horizon can help set the initial bank angle.
- **Cross-checking Instruments**: After setting the bank angle visually, the pilot should verify it using the attitude indicator, which shows the wing's angle relative to the horizon.

##### 2. **Control Input Considerations**
- **Control Input Size**: Beginning pilots should use small aileron and rudder inputs to allow more time for evaluating and correcting the turn.
- **Timing and Sequence of Inputs**:
 If the nose moves before the bank starts, rudder input is too early.
 If the bank starts before the nose turns, rudder input is too late.
If the nose moves up or down when banking, the elevator pressure is either too much or too little.

##### 3. **Maintaining the Turn**
- **Relaxing Control Pressures**: Once the bank angle is established, adjust or relax aileron and rudder pressures depending on the desired bank angle.
  - **Shallow Bank Angles**: Maintain slight aileron and rudder pressure into the bank direction.
  - **Medium Bank Angles**: Neutralize aileron and rudder inputs.
  - **Steep Bank Angles**: Apply opposite aileron and rudder to prevent the bank from steepening.
- **Maintaining Altitude**: Do not relax elevator back pressure, as it is essential to maintain the vertical component of lift.

##### 4. **Monitoring and Correcting During the Turn**
- **Visual and Instrument Cross-checks**: The pilot should continuously reference the natural horizon and scan for traffic, cross-checking instruments to ensure proper performance.
- **Airspeed Considerations**: In shallow turns, airspeed reduction due to drag is minimal, but in steeper turns, additional power may be required to maintain speed.
- **Altitude Maintenance**: If altitude is not maintained, adjust pitch attitude using visual references and cross-check with instruments.

##### 5. **Steep Turn Techniques**
- **Control Input Precision**: Steep turns require smooth, precise control inputs. Correct pitch attitude with proportional elevator back pressure while holding the bank angle constant.
- **Recovery from Nose-Low Attitude**: If the nose drops excessively, reduce the bank angle with coordinated aileron and rudder, then increase pitch attitude. Avoid using only the elevator, as it can steepen the bank and increase stress on the aircraft.
- **Power Management**: Use appropriate power adjustments to counteract drag during steep turns. Trimming the elevator may help maintain control as the bank angle exceeds 30°.

##### 6. **Rolling Out of a Turn**
- **Timing the Rollout**: Begin the rollout before reaching the desired heading, leading by half the bank angle (e.g., lead by 15° for a 30° bank).
- **Control Inputs**: Rollout is similar to roll-in but with control inputs in the opposite direction. Apply aileron and rudder toward the high wing, and relax elevator pressure as necessary to maintain altitude.
- **Final Adjustments**: As the wings level, smoothly neutralize controls. If trim was used, apply forward elevator pressure until the trim is adjusted. Use visual references and instruments to ensure the turn is stopped, and the aircraft returns to straight-and-level flight.


#### Turn Radius
The rate of turn depends on the horizontal lift component, which increases with a steeper bank angle, leading to a faster turn at a given airspeed. However, at higher airspeeds, more horizontal lift is needed to turn, causing the turn rate to slow down and the turn radius to increase.
As the turn radius decreases, a difference in airspeed develops between the inside and outside wings, with the outside wing moving faster and generating more lift. This causes an overbanking tendency, which must be corrected with opposite aileron. The increased lift on the outside wing also creates more drag, causing a slight slip during steep turns, which should be corrected with the rudder.

#### Rate of Turn
The rate of turn, normally measured in degrees per second,  is based upon a set bank angle at a set speed. If either one  of these elements changes, the rate of turn changes. If the  aircraft increases its speed without changing the bank angle,  the rate of turn decreases. Likewise, if the speed decreases  without changing the bank angle, the rate of turn increases. Changing the bank angle without changing speed also causes  the rate of turn to change. Increasing the bank angle without  changing speed increases the rate of turn, while decreasing  the bank angle reduces the rate of turn. The standard rate of turn, 3° per second, is used as the main  reference for bank angle. Therefore, the pilot must understand  how the angle of bank varies with speed changes, such  as slowing down for holding or an instrument approach.  Figure 4-15 shows the turn relationship with reference to a  constant bank angle or a constant airspeed, and the effects on  rate of turn and radius of turn. A rule of thumb for determining  the standard rate turn is to divide the airspeed by ten and add 7. An aircraft with an airspeed of 90 knots takes a bank  angle of 16° to maintain a standard rate turn (90 divided by  10 plus 7 equals 16°). 

#### Load factors
Load factor refers to the stress on an aircraft's structure when a force deflects it from a straight flight path. Load factor is the ratio of the aerodynamic force on the aircraft to its gross weight (e.g., lift divided by weight). A load factor of 3 means the force on the aircraft is three times its weight. Aircraft are designed with specific "limit load factors," which are the highest load factors they can handle under normal operating conditions. The aircraft must withstand these maximum load factors without sustaining structural damage.
During flight, especially in turns, the load factor increases as the bank angle steepens, causing a rise in centrifugal force. If the load factor becomes so great that  an increase in AOA cannot provide enough lift to support  the load, the wing stalls. Since the stalling speed increases  directly with the square root of the load factor, the pilot should be aware of the flight conditions during which the  load factor can become critical. Steep turns at slow airspeed, structural ice accumulation, and vertical gusts in turbulent  air can increase the load factor to a critical level.

#### Coordination of Rudder and Aileron Controls
Any time ailerons are used, adverse yaw is produced. Adverse  yaw is caused when the ailerons are deflected as a roll motion  (as in turn) is initiated. In a right turn, the right aileron is  deflected upward while the left is deflected downward. Lift is  increased on the left side and reduced on the right, resulting  in a bank to the right. However, as a result of producing lift  on the left, induced drag is also increased on the left side.  The drag causes the left wing to slow down, in turn causing  the nose of the aircraft to initially move (left) in the direction opposite of the turn. Correcting for this yaw with rudder, when  entering and exiting turns, is necessary for precise control of  the airplane when flying on instruments. The pilot can tell if  the turn is coordinated by checking the ball in the turn-andslip indicator or the turn coordinator. As the aircraft banks to enter a turn, a portion of the wing’s  vertical lift becomes the horizontal component; therefore,  without an increase in back pressure, the aircraft loses altitude  during the turn. The loss of vertical lift can be offset by  increasing the pitch in one-half bar width increments. Trim  may be used to relieve the control pressures; however, if used,  it has to be removed once the turn is complete. In a slipping turn, the aircraft is not turning at the rate  appropriate to the bank being used, and the aircraft falls to  the inside of the turn. The aircraft is banked too much for the  rate of turn, so the horizontal lift component is greater than  the centrifugal force. A skidding turn results from excess of centrifugal force over the horizontal lift component, pulling  the aircraft toward the outside of the turn. The rate of turn  is too great for the angle of bank, so the horizontal lift  component is less than the centrifugal force. An inclinometer, located in the turn coordinator, or turn and  bank indicator indicates the quality of the turn, and should  be centered when the wings are banked. If the ball is off of  center on the side toward the turn, the aircraft is slipping and  rudder pressure should be added on that side to increase the  rate of turn or the bank angle should be reduced. If the ball  is off of center on the side away from the turn, the aircraft  is skidding and rudder pressure toward the turn should be  relaxed or the bank angle should be increased. If the aircraft  is properly rigged, the ball should be in the center when the  wings are level; use rudder and/or aileron trim if available. The increase in induced drag (caused by the increase in  AOA necessary to maintain altitude) results in a minor loss  of airspeed if the power setting is not changed.


#### Common Errors
Common errors in level turns are:  1. Failure to adequately clear in the direction of turn for aircraft traffic.  2. Gaining or losing altitude during the turn.  3. Not holding the desired bank angle constant.  4. Attempting to execute the turn solely by instrument reference.  5. Leaning away from the direction of the turn while seated.  6. Insufficient feel for the airplane as evidenced by the inability to detect slips or skids without flight instruments.  7. Attempting to maintain a constant bank angle by referencing only the airplane’s nose. 8. Making skidding flat turns to avoid banking the airplane.  9. Holding excessive rudder in the direction of turn.  10. Gaining proficiency in turns in only one direction.  11. Failure to coordinate the controls. 

### Climbs
#### **Types of Climbs:**
- **Normal Climb:** Performed at an airspeed recommended by the aircraft manufacturer, often referred to as a cruise climb. It offers better engine cooling, control authority, and visibility.
- **Best Rate of Climb (VY):** Achieves the maximum altitude gain over time and is used immediately after takeoff until it is safe to transition to a normal climb.
- **Best Angle of Climb (VX):** Achieves the maximum altitude gain over a horizontal distance, useful for clearing obstacles after takeoff.

#### **Establishing a Climb:**
- The climb is initiated by increasing back pressure on the elevator to achieve the desired pitch attitude while simultaneously increasing engine power.
- As the airplane enters the climb, airspeed decreases, requiring more power to maintain a stable climb.

#### **Key Considerations:**
- **Power and Pitch:** Power is kept at a fixed climb setting, while airspeed is controlled through pitch adjustments. The correct pitch attitude is maintained relative to the horizon and cross-checked with flight instruments.
- **Propeller Effects:** In most aircraft, the propeller induces a left-turning tendency (P-factor) that requires compensation with right rudder pressure.
- **Trim:** Use of trim is emphasized to relieve control pressures and maintain the desired pitch attitude without constant manual input.

#### **Leveling Off from a Climb:**
The process of leveling off begins before reaching the desired altitude, approximately 10% of the climb rate in feet before the target altitude. Smoothly reduce the pitch attitude and allow the aircraft to accelerate to cruise speed before reducing power and retrimming the aircraft.

#### **Climbing Turns:**
Climbing turns require additional considerations as the bank angle increases, which decreases the rate of climb due to the increased lift required for turning. It’s recommended to use shallow bank angles during climbs to maintain efficiency.

#### **Common Errors:**
Errors include improper rudder usage during turns, chasing the airspeed indicator, and failing to maintain the correct pitch and bank during the climb.

### Descents
#### **Types of Descents:**
- **Partial Power Descent**: This is the normal method for losing altitude at a controlled rate, usually with a target descent rate of 500 feet per minute (fpm). It's often used during cruise or en route descent.
- **Descent at Minimum Safe Airspeed**: A nose-high, power-assisted descent, typically used for clearing obstacles during landing approaches on short runways.
- **Emergency Descent**: A rapid descent, often required in emergencies, utilizing high drag and high airspeed procedures as specified by the airplane's manual.

#### **Glides**:
A glide involves a controlled descent with little or no engine power, balancing the forces of gravity and lift. The glide ratio (distance traveled versus altitude lost) is critical, especially during emergency landings. When performing turns during a glide, pilots need to compensate for reduced lift and increased drag by applying more back pressure on the elevator. Proper coordination of flight controls is essential to avoid slips, skids, or inadvertent stalls, especially at low altitudes.

#### **Descent Techniques**:
To initiate a descent, pilots must adjust the throttle and pitch attitude while referencing the natural horizon and flight instruments. The goal is to maintain the desired airspeed and descent rate. The descent should be stabilized, and the airplane trimmed to relieve control pressures.

#### **Common Errors**:
- Failing to adequately clear for traffic during descent.
- Applying insufficient back pressure on the elevator during entry, leading to a steeper-than-desired descent.
- Focusing too much on flight instruments instead of the natural horizon.
- "Chasing" the airspeed indicator, resulting in an unstable descent.

## The Four Forces
An aircraft in flight is under the influence of four main forces: lift, weight. thrust, and drag.
In level flight two principal horizontal forces act on an aircraft - thrust and drag. Thrust is provided by the engine acting through the propeller. and drag by the resistance of the air to the passage through it of the aircraft and all its component parts.
The vertical forces acting on an airc raft are lift and weight. Weight is the total weight of the aircraft and its contents; it is considered to act through a single point termed the Centre of Gravity . Lift acts at 90 degrees to the relative airflow is not necessarily perpendicular to the horizon; in flight it may act at a considerable angle to the horizon. For computation purposes, the total force of lift is considered to act through one point of the wing. This point is called the Centre of Pressure.


## Altitude Flying
#### Attitude Determination and Importance
An airplane’s attitude is determined by the angular difference between a specific axis and the natural horizon.  A false horizon can occur when the natural horizon is obscured or not readily apparent. 

####  Attitude Types
- **Pitch Attitude**: The angle formed between the airplane’s longitudinal axis, which extends from the nose to the tail of the airplane, and the natural horizon.
- **Bank Attitude**: The angle formed by the airplane’s lateral axis, which extends from wingtip to wingtip, and the natural horizon.
- **Yaw Attitude**: Angular difference about the airplane’s vertical axis (yaw) is an attitude relative to the airplane’s direction of flight but not relative to the natural horizon.

#### Components of Airplane Attitude Control
- **Pitch Control**: Controlling the airplane’s pitch attitude about the lateral axis by using the elevator to raise and lower the nose in relation to the natural horizon or the airplane’s flight instrumentation.
- **Bank Control**: Controlling the airplane about the longitudinal axis by using the ailerons to attain a desired bank angle in relation to the natural horizon or the airplane’s instrumentation.
- **Power Control**: Controlled by the throttle in most general aviation airplanes, it is used when the flight situation requires a specific thrust setting or a change in thrust to meet a specific objective.
- **Trim Control**: Used to relieve the control pressures held by the pilot on the flight controls after a desired attitude has been attained.
Airplane attitude control is composed of four components: pitch control, bank (roll) control, power control, and trim.
-  **Yaw Control**: Note that yaw control is used to cancel out the effects of yaw-induced changes, such as adverse yaw and effects of the propeller.

## Integrated Flight Instruction
Intergated Flight Instruction involves using both outside references (natural horizon) and flight instruments to establish and maintain desired flight attitudes and performance.
### The basic elements of integrated flight instruction
The pilot visually controls the airplane’s attitude in reference outside to the natural horizon. Approximately 90 percent of the pilot’s attention should be devoted to outside visual references and scanning for airborne traffic. No more than about 10 percent of the pilot’s attention should be inside the flight deck. Continuous visual checks of the outside references and immediate corrections made by the pilot minimize  the chance for the airplane to deviate from the desired heading, altitude, and flightpath.
The pilot should become familiar with the relationship between outside visual references to the natural horizon and the corresponding flight instrument indications. A pitch attitude adjustment may require a movement of the pilot’s reference point of  several inches in relation to the natural horizon but correspond to a seemingly insignificant movement of the reference bar on the  airplane’s attitude indicator. A deviation from a desired bank angle, which is obvious when referencing the airplane’s wingtips or cowling relative to the natural horizon, may be imperceptible on the airplane’s attitude indicator to the beginner pilot. 
### Common errors
The most common error made by the beginner pilot is to make pitch or bank corrections while still looking inside. It is also common  for beginner pilots to fixate on the flight instruments—a conscious effort is required by them to return to outside visual references.


## Flight Controls
The airplane flies in an environment that allows it to travel up and down as well as left and right. Note that movement up or down depends on the flight conditions. If the airplane is right-side up relative to the horizon, forward control stick or wheel (elevator control) movement will result in a loss of altitude. If the same airplane is upside-down relative to the horizon that same forward control movement will result in a gain of altitude.
Aircraft flight control systems consist of primary and  secondary systems. The ailerons, elevator,  and rudder constitute the primary control system and are  required to control an aircraft safely during flight. Wing flaps, leading edge devices, spoilers, and trim systems constitute  the secondary control system and improve the performance  characteristics of the airplane or relieve the pilot of excessive  control forces. 


### Primary Flight Controls
#### Ailerons
Ailerons control roll about the longitudinal axis. The ailerons  are attached to the outboard trailing edge of each wing and  move in the opposite direction from each other. Moving the control wheel, or control stick, to the right  causes the right aileron to deflect upward and the left aileron  to deflect downward. The upward deflection of the right  aileron decreases the camber resulting in decreased lift on  the right wing. The corresponding downward deflection of  the left aileron increases the camber resulting in increased  lift on the left wing. Thus, the increased lift on the left wing  and the decreased lift on the right wing causes the aircraft  to roll to the right. 

#### Elevator 
The elevator controls pitch about the lateral axis. Aft movement of the control column raises the elevator's trailing edge, creating a downward aerodynamic force that pitches the nose up. Forward movement of the control column has the opposite effect, increasing camber, creating more lift on the horizontal stabilizer/elevator, and pitching the nose down.

#### Rudder
The rudder controls movement of the aircraft about its vertical axis. This motion is called yaw. Like the other primary control surfaces, the rudder is a movable surface hinged to a fixed surface in this case, to the vertical stabilizer or fin. The rudder is controlled by the left and right rudder pedals. When the rudder is deflected into the airflow, a horizontal force is exerted in the opposite direction. By pushing the left pedal, the rudder moves left. This alters the airflow around the vertical stabilizer/rudder and creates a sideward lift that moves the tail to the right and yaws the nose of the airplane to the left. Rudder effectiveness increases with speed; therefore, large deflections at low speeds and small deflections at high speeds may be required to provide the desired reaction. In propeller-driven aircraft, any slipstream flowing over the rudder increases its effectiveness.

##### Adverse Yaw
Since the downward deflected aileron produces more lift as  evidenced by the wing raising, it also produces more drag.  This added drag causes the wing to slow down slightly.  This results in the aircraft yawing toward the wing which  had experienced an increase in lift (and drag). From the  pilot’s perspective, the yaw is opposite the direction of the bank. The adverse yaw is a result of differential drag and the  slight difference in the velocity of the left and right wings. 
Adverse yaw becomes more pronounced at low airspeeds.  At these slower airspeeds, aerodynamic pressure on control  surfaces are low, and larger control inputs are required to effectively maneuver the aircraft. As a result, the increase  in aileron deflection causes an increase in adverse yaw. The yaw is especially evident in aircraft with long wing spans. Application of the rudder is used to counteract adverse  yaw. The amount of rudder control required is greatest at  low airspeeds, high angles of attack, and with large aileron  deflections. Like all control surfaces at lower airspeeds,  the vertical stabilizer/rudder becomes less effective and  magnifies the control problems associated with adverse yaw. All turns are coordinated by use of ailerons, rudder, and  elevator. Applying aileron pressure is necessary to place  the aircraft in the desired angle of bank, while simultaneous  application of rudder pressure is necessary to counteract the  resultant adverse yaw. Additionally, because more lift is  required during a turn than during straight-and-level flight,  the angle of attack (AOA) must be increased by applying  elevator back pressure. The steeper the turn, the more elevator  back pressure that is needed. As the desired angle of bank is established, aileron and  rudder pressures should be relaxed. This stops the angle of  bank from increasing, because the aileron and rudder control  surfaces are in a neutral and streamlined position. Elevator  back pressure should be held constant to maintain altitude.  The roll-out from a turn is similar to the roll-in, except the  flight controls are applied in the opposite direction. The  aileron and rudder are applied in the direction of the roll-out  or toward the high wing. As the angle of bank decreases,  the elevator back pressure should be relaxed as necessary  to maintain altitude. 

### Pitch and Power Relationship
The relationship between pitch and power is vital in controlling an aircraft's flight path and airspeed. When airspeed decreases, the pilot must increase the pitch by raising the nose to maintain lift. This is done by applying back pressure on the elevator, which increases the angle of attack (AOA) and lift. However, this downward pressure on the tail requires energy, which reduces the aircraft's speed. The closer the aircraft's center of gravity (CG) is to the rear, the less downward force is needed, improving performance.
The pilot uses the throttle to control thrust and airspeed, while pitch controls the flight path. When pitch is adjusted, power must also be adjusted to maintain constant lift. For example, to accelerate without climbing, the pilot increases thrust and lowers the pitch to maintain altitude. Conversely, to decelerate while maintaining altitude, the pilot decreases thrust and raises the pitch to compensate for the reduced lift.

### Stick Control
#### Pitch Control
When pulling the elevator pitch control toward the pilot, which is an aft movement of the control wheel, yoke, control stick, or side stick controller (referred to as adding back pressure), the airplane’s nose will rotate backwards relative to the pilot around the pitch (lateral) axis of the airplane. Think of this movement from the pilot’s feet to the pilot’s head. 
When pushing elevator pitch control toward the instrument panel, (referred to as increasing forward pressure), the airplane rotates the nose forward relative to the pilot around the pitch axis of the airplane. Think of this movement from the pilot’s head to the pilot’s feet. 
#### Aileron control
When right pressure is applied to the aileron control, which rotates the control wheel or yoke clockwise, or deflects the control stick or side stick to the right, the airplane’s right wing banks (rolls) lower in relation to the pilot. Think of this movement from the pilot’s head to the pilot’s right hip. 
When left pressure is applied to the aileron control, which rotates the control wheel or yoke counterclockwise, or deflects the control stick or side stick to the left, the airplane’s left wing banks (rolls) lower in relation to the pilot. Think of this movement from the pilot’s head to the pilot’s left hip. 

### Rudder Control
When forward pressure is applied to the right rudder pedal, the airplane’s nose moves (yaws) to the right in relation to the pilot. Think of this movement from the pilot’s left shoulder to the pilot’s right shoulder.
When forward pressure is applied to the left rudder pedal, the airplane’s nose moves (yaws) to the left in relation to the pilot. Think of this movement from the pilot’s right shoulder to the pilot’s left shoulder.
