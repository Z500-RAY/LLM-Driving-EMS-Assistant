## Risk Management and Solution
 - Insufficient Back Pressure 
	 - Symptoms: 
		 - High angle of bank 
		 - High rate of descent 
		 - Increased speed 
		 - Increased G-force 
	 - Solution: 
		 - Gently apply back pressure 
		 - Adopt a normal cruise attitude 
		 - Adopt initial altitude

 - Too much Back Pressure 
	 - Symptoms: 
		 - High nose attitude
		 - High angle of bank
		 - Decreasing Speed
	 - Solution: 
		 - Reduce back pressure 
		 - Lower the nose attitude
