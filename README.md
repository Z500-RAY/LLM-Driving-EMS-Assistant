# Flight Skills Operation Learning Experience Questionnaire

The "Flight Skills Operation Learning Experience Questionnaire" excel contains questionnaire questions.

# Flight Knowledge Base
The "Flight Knowledge Base" pdf document includes the documents loaded in the flight knowledge base. There are 3 types of documents, namely Basic Flight Knowledge, Aircraft Type-Specific Documentation and Mission Specific Documentation. Due to space limitations, the aircraft type-specific documentation section selects the DA40 as the representative model and lists the relevant documents. And the Mission Specific Documentation section selects steep turns as the representative mission and lists the relevant documents.

# Task Processing Example

The "Task Processing Example" pdf document gives an example of how the guidance generation processes the flight data in the specific task. The input of the whole module, and the prompt and the output of each part of the "analyse" are included.
